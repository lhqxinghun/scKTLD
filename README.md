# scKTLD

## 1. Introduction
scKTLD is a method designed for the identification of TAD-like domains on single-cell Hi-C data. It treats the Hi-C contact matrix as a graph, embeds its structures into a low-dimensional space by combining sparse matrix factorization and spectral propagation, and identifies the TAD-like domains in the embedding space via a kernel model optimized by PELT
